This project is a final, user-facing application.

It is local-first and strictly non-commercial.

All processing must run locally.
Do not suggest cloud services, SaaS APIs, telemetry, or external servers.

Target stack (do not deviate):
- Firefox WebExtension
- Local FastAPI backend
- GPU-accelerated neural Text-to-Speech

Primary goals:
- Human-like speech quality
- Privacy by design
- Low latency
- Stable and maintainable code

Coding expectations:
- Prefer complete, production-ready files
- Avoid pseudo-code and placeholders
- Keep architecture simple and explicit
- Modularize only when it improves clarity

TTS & Audio rules:
- Neural TTS only
- Local execution only
- Browser-native TTS APIs are forbidden
- Cloud TTS services are forbidden
- Third-party audio streaming is forbidden

Audio output:
- Default format: WAV
- One request generates exactly one audio output
- Do not apply audio post-processing unless explicitly requested
- Do not return partial or corrupted audio

GPU usage:
- Always detect CUDA availability
- Use GPU when available
- Fallback to CPU gracefully
- Never assume GPU presence

Performance:
- Minimize latency
- Avoid unnecessary model reloads
- Load TTS models once at startup

Assume Linux as the primary development and runtime environment.
